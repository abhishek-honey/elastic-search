# Elasticsearch

[Brew Installation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/brew.html)

Install Elasticsearch on macOS with Homebrewedit
Elastic publishes Homebrew formulae so you can install Elasticsearch with the Homebrew package manager.

To install with Homebrew, you first need to tap the Elastic Homebrew repository:

```
brew tap elastic/tap
```
Once youâ€™ve tapped the Elastic Homebrew repo, you can use brew install to install the default distribution of Elasticsearch:

```
brew install elastic/tap/elasticsearch-full
```
This installs the most recently released default distribution of Elasticsearch. To install the OSS distribution, specify ```elastic/tap/elasticsearch-oss```.

#### Server will be running at ```localhost:9200```
